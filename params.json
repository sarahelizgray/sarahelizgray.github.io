During installation,  select the option \"Run Git and included Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt.\" This will allow you to use the git help command, which uses the Unix man tool.\r\n\r\nAfter installation, open a terminal window (on Windows, click the Start menu and type cmd). Enter the command git in a newly opened terminal/command prompt window. If the installation succeeded, this will show you a list of git commands.\r\n\r\nTo open a command prompt on windows, open\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Install Ruby\r\n\r\nTo install githug on your own computer, first install Ruby. Ruby is a very nice programming language, similar to Python. If you are using Mac OS X, you already have Ruby. There are various ways to install Ruby on a Windows computer; I used [http://rubyinstaller.org/](http://rubyinstaller.org/); when you run the installer, choose the option to add the Ruby executables to your PATH.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Fork the reptiles repo and complete class exercises\r\nFork the reptiled repo at [https://github.com/sarahelizgray/reptiles](https://github.com/sarahelizgray/reptiles).\r\nOnce you have forked the repo to your GitHub account, get it on your local machine by cloning.\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:sarahelizgray/reptiles.git\r\n```\r\nExercises for this step are in the repo's README file.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Install githug\r\n\r\nOpen a terminal window (on Windows, click the Start menu and type cmd), then enter the command\r\n``` \r\n    gem install githug\r\n```\r\n### Step 5: Play githug\r\n\r\nFrom the command line, type githug, and start playing. This game covers concepts beyond the scope of this class, you will need the man git/git help and google to do some research. Have fun!\r\n\r\n*some content on this page stolen, with gratitude, from [Dr. Dave Matuszek](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit591-2012/Pages/githug.html) ","google":"UA-33893938-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
